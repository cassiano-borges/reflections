When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to access my projects from any other computer, and don't
    risk losing the files. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Prevent editing the local code if it is not intended.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks works only within GitHub environment, creating a copy of a repository
        into one account.
    Clone copies a repository from Github into your local machine. If one is 
        cloning a repository from own GitHub account, it automatically creates a remote.
    Branches works on local environment, to create multiple versions or paths of a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
